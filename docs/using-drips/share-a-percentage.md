title: Share a Percentage of Incoming Drips
---

One exciting feature of Drips is that any user with an Ethereum address who receives 
funds to their [Ethereum address directly][rf], using Drips, can choose to set up
"Drip shares" to redirect a portion of the funds they receive to other users, 
who, for example, might be other collaborators, collectives or software libraries 
the user depends on.

We'll show you how it works below.

To get started, open a new browser tab and head over to the Drips webapp at [drips.network][dw].

>If you haven't done so already, the first thing you'll want to do is [Connect a Wallet][cw] so that
you can see any funds you've received and also manage the Drips setup for your account. Make sure 
you have a wallet connected before proceeding.

Assuming you have a wallet connected, you will see your user icon in the top right corner of the screen
in the Drips web app. Click on it 
to go to the page for your user account. That page will look something like the page shown in the 
image below. To set up a new Drip sharing rule, click on the "Drips" button, also indicated in the image.
  
![User Profile Page][d1]

Your Drips page should look like the image below. To create a new Drip share, click "Add Drips", as
shown in the image below.

![Drips Page][d2]

Click on the "Share %" button, as shown below.

![Share Modal][s1]

On the next page, shown below, you can configure as many Drip sharing rules as you would like. To
add a share, click the "+" sign and then specify a percentage of incoming funds you wish to share
and the Ethereum address you wish the funds to be dripped to. You can configure as many Drip
sharing rules as you like this way.

![Share Modal][s2]

When you're finished, click "Update" to continue.

You'll be prompted by your wallet to approve the transaction. Once you do so, wait for
the transaction to be confirmed. You're done! You can cancel out of this screen and you'll
be returned to your account page.

Nice work -- your Drip sharing rules are all set up!
