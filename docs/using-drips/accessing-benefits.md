title: Accessing Benefits
---

This guide is intended for fans who are interested in accessing a benefit offered by 
a Community for which they hold a member token. 

## Understanding Limitations of Benefits

Is is important to understand that benefits are an optional feature, and not all creators / 
Communities will choose to offer them. Even if a creator does to decide to offer one specific type
of benefit (e.g. a private Discord channel), they may not decide to offer other types (e.g. Snapshot
voting). Before trying to access a specific type of benefit, members should confirm that the benefit 
is actually offered by the Community that they belong to.

## Benefit: Private Channels on Discord

If a Community you are a member of offers access to one or more private channels on their Discord
server, you can access them as follows:

- Go to any public channel on the Discord server for the community and enter `!join`.

- Complete the interactions with the Collab.land bot to verify that you hold a member token for the
Community.

## Benefit: Voting on Snapshot

If a Community you are a member of offers access to a Snapshot space for voting, you can participate
in voting there using your member token as follows:

- First, you'll need to determine the name of the Snapshot Space for the Community. It's possible
that the Community creator will post this on social media. You can also try to find it by searching
for it at [snapshot.org][sn]

- Once you've located the Snapshot space for your community, follow [these instructions][si] to
participate in voting on proposals there.
