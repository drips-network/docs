Due to the open nature of the blockchain, all activity on the Drips network is public and transparent. The Drips app allows you to freely view any address' *profile*, which is essentially a read-only representation of their dashboard.

You can view your own profile by hovering over your address or ENS name in the top-right corner, and clicking "Profile". You can share your profile URL with third parties, and they'll be able to see the exact same view, even without connecting a wallet. Social media links and the profile description are taken from the ENS record associated with the given Ethereum address, if any.

To view someone else's profile, navigate to `drips.network/< address >`, where `< address >` can be an ENS name or Ethereum address.

You can also use the app's search bar to jump to any ENS name or Ethereum address at any time.

### For developers: Inspecting AddressDriver-controlled Drips User IDs

Alongside addresses or ENS names, you may also enter a numeric AddressDriver Drips User ID into the search bar or URL to inspect said profile.

> ⚠️ The Drips App currently does not support inspecting NFTDriver-controlled sub-accounts. This is coming soon!
