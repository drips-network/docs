#### How to Get Testnet Eth and DAI

The main faucet for the Goerli testnet is now operated by Alchemy. You will need to sign up for an Alchemy account to get testnet
ETH and you can do so [here][gf]. Alternately, you can use [this proof-of-work faucet][gp].

To get DAI on Goerli:

1. First get testnet ETH from the faucet.

2. Go to https://app.compound.finance/ and connect a wallet, then make sure your wallet is connected to the Goerli testnet.

3. Click on `DAI`, select `Withdraw` and scroll down to a `Faucet` link.
