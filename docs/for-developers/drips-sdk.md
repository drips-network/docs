title: The Drips JS SDK
---

The <a href="https://github.com/radicle-dev/drips-js-sdk" target="_blank">Drips Javascript SDK</a> allows web developers to easily incorporate streaming and splitting functionality into web apps and other applications that can run Javascript code. The SDK
repository also includes two fully self-contained example web applications that illustrate how Drips works in practice.

### Code-Level Documentation

Code-level (types, methods, parameters) docs are available in a hosted version <a href="https://melodious-bombolone-ca37e0.netlify.app/" target="_blank">here</a>, or can be generated from a local copy of the SDK repository using typedoc.
