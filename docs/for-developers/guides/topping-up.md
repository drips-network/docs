*Note: this guide builds on code included with the NFT Driver example app from the Drips SDK repository. Therefore as a prerequisite to being able to follow the instructions in this guide yourself, you will need to first clone the Drips SDK repo and build the NFT Driver example app as described [here][in]. Additionally, you will need to make sure you have completed the instructions in the [guide][ca] "Creating an App-Specific Drips Account", to ensure that you have at least one NFT-based sub-account available for you to top-up with funds.*

## Go to the 'List an Owner's Accounts' Screen

First, go back to the main screen for the NFT Driver Example App at `http://localhost:5173/`. From there, click the `List an Owner's Accounts` link on that page.
