## I'm a creator/developer. How do I raise funds using Drips?
Head over to the [Create a Community][cc] section for instructions on how to
set up your Community and issue member tokens for your fans to purchase.

## I want to purchase a membership to a Community I'm a fan of. How do I do that?
Please see the [Purchase a Membership][pm] section for instructions on how to
purchase a membership token for a Community you wish to support.

## Is it posssible to drip funds using ETH or an ERC-20 token other than DAI?
In the current version of Drips, DAI is the only token that can be dripped to other
users or Communities. However the Drips team is actively working to add support for
dripping other types of tokens in the next version of the protocol. 

## Do I need to have Eth in my account to send or receive DAI using Drips?
Users of Drips do need to have Eth (or MATIC for the Polygon version of Drips)
available in their wallet to cover transaction fees associated with creating Drips (if sending
DAI) or collecting (if receiving DAI).
