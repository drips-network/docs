### Are there fees for using Drips?
The Drips Protocol is free to use and does not impose any fees on users. Users will still need to pay gas
fees to interact with the Drips Contracts as they would with any contract on Ethereum.

Third-party apps building on Drips may choose to impose fees of their own.

### Do I need to have Eth in my account to send or receive tokens using Drips?
Users of Drips do need to have Eth (or the appropriate analagous gas token to ETH if on a non-mainnet network)
available in their wallet to cover transaction fees associated with creating or modifying Drips and Splits.
