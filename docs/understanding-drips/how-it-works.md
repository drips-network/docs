<td style="border: 0px; vertical-align: top;"><b>1</b> - A creator or developer chooses a funding goal and minimum supporter contribution and then creates a Community using the Drips web app at <a href="https://drips.radicle.network/">drips.radicle.network</a>. Behind the scenes, the new Community is deployed to the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-721 contract, which is 100% owned and controlled by the creator.

Examples of <a href="../using-drips/setting-up-benefits.html">benefits<a> include access to gated Discord channels or the ability to participate in governance polls using Snapshot.

<td style="border: 0px; vertical-align: top;"><b>3</b> - Supporters who wish to purchase memberships and "Drip" to the creator can do so by navigating to the page for the new Community in the Drips web app and clicking "Fund". They will then be prompted to choose an amount of DAI they would like to donate and also an amount of DAI that they would like to set aside in advance to use for payment. An NFT membership badge is minted and sent to their Ethereum address. The NFT serves as both a badge of support and also a key that unlocks access to the benefits offered.

Recipients of these drip "shares" could be contributors, charities, or other projects that they Community depends upon (e.g. a software library or other dependency).
