The Drips protocol is a collection of public, open smart contracts deployed on EVM-based blockchains, equally accessible
to every user
and application. Because of this, there is no one single way of interacting with the Drips protocol. While the Drips App is
one way of interacting with the Drips protocol, users can also access the full power and functionality of Drips contracts in 
any of the following alternative ways as well:

[The Drips SDK][sd] is a Javascript SDK that allows any application or user-created code to interact directly with the Drips smart contracts and utilize the full feature set of the protocol in whatever way they wish. Drips contracts can be freely integrated into
any website, dapp or application at any time using the SDK.

[Etherscan][es] is a block explorer and analytics platform for Ethereum. Other networks have similar block exploerers,
often also operated by Etherscan. The Drips contracts can be accessed using these block explorers at the addresses
specified on the [Smart Contract and Subgraph Details][sc] page.

[ethBuild][eb] is an educational sandbox for web3, including drag-and-drop programming and open source building blocks. With
ethBuild, you can call a function on an Ethereum contract (for example, to create a Drip or Split configuration) by
sending it a transaction with the function arguments in the data.

[MyEtherWallet][me] is a free, client side interface helping you interact with the Ethereum blockchain. Their easy-to-use, open-source platform allows you to generate wallets, interact with (Drips) smart contracts, and more.

The [web3.js Library][w3] makes it easy to interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, including the Drips smart
contracts.

The [ethers.js Library][et] is another Javascript library for interacting directly with Ethereum smart contracts, including the
Drips smart contracts.
