Before you can stream a token to someone, you'll need to add funds to your Drips account's *outgoing balance*. Your outgoing balance funds any outgoing streams for a given ERC-20 token. Of course, you may freely <a href="/docs/streaming-and-splitting/manage-funds/withdraw-funds" target="_blank">withdraw money</a> back from your outgoing balance to your wallet any time.

To get started, locate the "Add funds" button on your dashboard. The first step is to select which ERC-20 token you'd like to add to your account.

The app supports many popular ERC-20 tokens out of the box. If you can't find the token you'd like to add, you may also configure the app with a *custom token* by scrolling all the way to the bottom of the list and clicking "Add custom token".

In the next step, simply indicate the amount of the selected token you'd like to add to your account.

After confirming, if it's the first time you're adding this particular ERC-20, the app may prompt you to grant "approval" to the Drips protocol.

"Approval" in this context entails you letting the specific ERC-20 token contract know that the Drips smart contract is allowed to access your funds. The app always requests maximum approval, meaning that you won't have to send this extra transaction the next time you top up the same token.

Moving on â€” If you were prompted to grant approval, you can do so by clicking "Trigger approve transaction" and signing the transaction with your wallet. Once confirmed, the app automatically resumes the flow.

Next, the app will prompt you to sign the top-up transaction. Confirm in your wallet, and wait for confirmation.

Once confirmed, your funds will appear on your dashboard below the "Balances" section as "Outgoing". If your balance doesn't immediately appear, please refresh the app a few times, as it sometimes might take a short while for it to update.
