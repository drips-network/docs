title: Fund Your Dependencies
---

Drips makes it easy for anyone, anywhere to directly fund and support the software projects they depend on the most! Regardless of whether you represent a large organization building on critical FOSS infrastructure or are an indviidual interested in giving something back to the open source libraries you use every day, read on to learn how Drips makes it easy to fund your critical dependencies.

## Create a Drip List

Drip Lists are a powerful new feature in Drips V2 that enables anyone to publicly create and fund lists of FOSS projects and maintainers they care about the most. Want to give it a try?

Start by navigating to the <a href="https://drips.network/" target="_blank">Drips App</a> and then click on "Open App" in the top right corner of the page to open the Drips Webapp. Next, you will need to connect a web3 wallet to start using the app.

Once your wallet is connected, click on the "Drip Lists" button in the menu on the left and then click on "Create Drip List".

Next, you can choose the Github projects, Ethereum addresses or ENS names you would like to include in your list. Add these one-by-one by pasting either an Ethereum address, ENS name, or a link to a Github *repository* into the box and clicking "Add" as shown in the screenshot below. Note that if you're pasting a Github link, it must be the URL for a repository, not a link to a user's account or a Github organization.

Once you've added all of the recipients you would like to include in your list, you will need to specify the percentage of funds sent to the list that will be allocated to each recipient. You can either enter a percentage manually in the box next to each entry, or use some of the helpful tools provided by the app like the "Distribue Evenly" button, or "Distribute Remaining". The percentages must sum to 100%.

Once you have assigned percentages to each recpient, choose a name to give to your Drip List and click "Continue".

Next, you'll need to select the type of token you wish to stream to your Drip List and the rate at which the token will be streamed. Tokens streamed to the Drip List are sent continuously, and split amongst the recipients. You can learn more about how streaming and splitting work <a href="/docs/the-protocol/overview">here</a>.
