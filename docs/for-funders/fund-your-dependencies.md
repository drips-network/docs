title: Fund Your Dependencies
---

Drips makes it easy for anyone, anywhere to directly fund and support the software projects they depend on the most! Regardless of whether you represent a large organization building on critical FOSS infrastructure or are an individual interested in giving something back to the open source libraries you use every day, read on to learn how Drips makes it easy to fund your critical dependencies.

## Create a Drip List

Drip Lists are a powerful new feature in Drips V2 that enables anyone to publicly create and fund lists of FOSS projects and maintainers they care about the most. Want to give it a try?

Start by navigating to <a href="https://drips.network/" target="_blank">drips.network</a> and then click on "Open App" in the top right corner of the page to open the Drips Web app. Next, you will need to connect a web3 wallet to start using the app.

Once your wallet is connected, click on the "Drip Lists" button in the menu on the left and then click on "Create Drip List".

Next, you can choose the Github projects, Ethereum addresses or ENS names you would like to include in your list. Add these one-by-one by pasting either an Ethereum address, ENS name, or a link to a Github *repository* into the box and clicking "Add" as shown in the screenshot below. Note that if you're pasting a Github link, it must be the URL for a repository, not a link to a user's account or a Github organization.

Once you've added all of the recipients you would like to include, you will need to specify the percentage of funds sent to the list that will be allocated to each recipient. You can either enter a percentage manually in the box next to each entry, or use some of the helpful tools provided by the app like the "Distribue Evenly" button, or "Distribute Remaining". The percentages must sum to 100% in order to continue.

Once you have assigned percentages to each recipient, choose a name to give to your Drip List and click "Continue".

Next, you'll need to select the type of token you wish to stream to your Drip List and the rate at which the token will be streamed. Tokens streamed to the Drip List are sent continuously, and split amongst the recipients based on the percentages you chose in the previous step. You can learn more about how streaming and splitting work <a href="/docs/the-protocol/overview">here</a>.

You'll also need to decide how much to top-up. Funds that are topped-up are sent to the Drips smart contracts and stored there as your balance of funds, which your streams continuously send from. You can withdraw funds that have not yet been streamed at any time. When you have entered the amount you wish to top-up, click "Continue".

Next, you have the opportunity to review everything you've entered in previous steps. Note that this is your last chance to make changes before sending the transactions that create your Drip List, so take some time to review the details before proceeding. If you would like to change anything, you can do so by clicking the "go back" button. When you are ready to go ahead with creating the list, click "Continue".

You will be prompted to sign two different transactions by your wallet. The first transaction approves the withdrawal of funds to top-up your drips account based on the top-up amount you chose and the second transaction creates your Drip List on chain based on the details you specified.

You will need to sign both transactions using your wallet. The exact details of what this will look like will differ based on the type of wallet you're using. See <a href="/streaming-and-splitting/advanced/safe" target="_blank">here</a> for details about how to use a Safe with Drips.

Once you have confirmed both transactions you may need to wait a few moments for them to excute, and assuming they succeed.... voila! You have created your first Drip List and you will be sent to the Drips profile page for your account, where you can see your new Drip List along with your other account details.

Congratulations and thank you for contributing to supporting FOSS as a public good!
