To use many of the features of Drips, you'll need to connect with an Ethereum wallet. We'll walk you through how to do so using the Drips webapp below.  However, there are several ways to interact with the Drips protocols and components, as laid out [here][ad] and [here][to].

To get started, head over to the Drips webapp at [drips.radicle.xyz][dw].

If you've used the Drips webapp in the past, you might see a user icon with a masked version of your Ethereum address in the top right corner of the window, indicated by the green box in the image below. If so, you have nothing more to do -- you're already connected!

![User Profile Icon][d1]

However, if you've never used the Drips webapp before, or haven't used it for some time, you will more likely see a button in the top right corner that says "Connect", and you'll need to click on that button and choose the type of wallet you would like to connect with, as shown below.
  
![Connect Wallet][d2]

The exact steps required to connect are different for each wallet, but typically the process is as
simple as clicking "approve" or "confirm" in the browser plugin window that pops up.

If you're successful, you will see an icon in the top right with a masked version of your
Ethereum address, which you can click on to go to your user profile page whenever you wish.
An example of what a user profile page looks like is shown below.
  
![Connect Wallet][d4]

If you see the icon and are able to click it to get to your user page, great job -- you're
connected!
