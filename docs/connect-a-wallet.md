To use many of the features of Drips, you'll need to connect with an Ethereum wallet. We'll walk
you through how to do so below.

To get started, head over to the Drips webapp at [drips.radicle.xyz][dw].

If you've used Drips in the past, you might see a user icon with a masked version of your Ethereum
address in the top right corner of the window, indicated by the green box in the image below. If
so, you have nothing more to do -- you're already connected!

However, if you've never used Drips before, or haven't used it for some time, you will more likely see a
button in the top right corner that says "Connect", and you'll need to click on that button and
choose the type of wallet you would like to connect with, as shown below.

The exact steps required to connect are different for each wallet, but typically the process is as
simple as clicking "approve" or "confirm" in the browser plugin window that pops up.

If you're successful, you will see an icon in the top right with a masked version of your
Ethereum address, which you can click on to go to your user profile page whenever you wish.
An example of what a user profile page looks like is shown below.

If you see the icon and are able to click it to get to your user page, great job -- you're
connected!
