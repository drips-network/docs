title: The Drips JS SDK
---

The <a href="https://github.com/radicle-dev/drips-js-sdk" target="_blank">Drips Javascript SDK</a> allows web developers to easily incorporate streaming and splitting functionality into
web apps and other applications that can run Javascript code.

In this section, we dive deep into the SDK, discuss its capabilities, walk through some
example code and see how you can get started incorporating the SDK into your project. Before diving in, here are a few other key resources related to the SDK:

**Code-Level Documentation** -
Documentaion about the JS SDK repository and code-level (types, methods, parameters) docs can be generated locally
using Typedoc and are also available in a hosted version <a href="https://melodious-bombolone-ca37e0.netlify.app/" target="_blank">here</a>.

**Hosted Example Apps** -
The JS SDK ships with two fully self-contained example web apps that are meant to show how the SDK works and how
developers can use it. These apps are also handly little tools for setting Drips and Splits and are useful for debugging
in their own right. While you can easily run local versions of these example apps on your own machine once you've
cloned the repo, hosted versions are also available at the links below:

* <a href="https://drips-js-sdk.vercel.app/" target="_blank">NFTDriver Example App</a>

*Note: the example apps -- including the hosted versions -- are intended to be used for testing and development purposes only, not for production.*

**How to Add Drips to Your Project**
The SDK will be added to npm soon, but for now you can now include it into your project's package.json as a dependency by using the command:

`npm install https://github.com/radicle-dev/drips-js-sdk#v2`
