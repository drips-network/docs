### Are there fees for using Drips?
The Drips Protocol is free to use and does not impose any fees on users. Users will still need to pay gas
fees to interact with the Drips Contracts as they would with any contract on Ethereum.

Third-party apps building on Drips may choose to impose fees of their own.

### Do I need to have Eth in my account to send or receive tokens using Drips?
Users of Drips do need to have ETH (or the analagous gas token to ETH if on a non-mainnet network)
available in their wallet to cover transaction fees, if they wish to create Drips or Splits to 
stream or share funds with others. Users to not need to have ETH in their accounts to receive
funds from other users who are Dripping or Splitting to them. However they will need to have
a small amount of ETH available in their account when they are ready to collect funds sent to
them (again, to cover gas costs of sending the collect transaction).
