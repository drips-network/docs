# Accessing Drips

Drips is an open-source application and protocol built on Ethereum, a publicly-accessible, global blockchain. While we've built the Drips App for simple interaction with Drips' underlying smart contracts, there are a multitude of alternative tools that enable interaction with the Drips Protocol, some of which are listed below.

- [The Drips SDK][sd] is a Javascript SDK that allows any application or user-created code to interact directly with the Drips smart contracts and utilize the full feature set of the protocol in whatever way they wish. Drips contracts can be freely integrated into any website, dapp or application at any time using the SDK.

- [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) is a block explorer and analytics platform for Ethereum. Other networks have similar block explorers, often also operated by Etherscan. The Drips contracts can be accessed using these block explorers at the addresses specified on the [Smart Contract and Subgraph Details](the-protocol/smart-contract-details) page. Other networks have similar block explorers.

- [ethBuild][eb] is an educational sandbox for web3, including drag-and-drop programming and open source building blocks. With ethBuild, you can call a function on an Ethereum contract (for example, to create a Drip or Split configuration) by sending it a transaction with the function arguments in the data.

- [MyEtherWallet][me] is a free, client side interface helping you interact with the Ethereum blockchain. Their easy-to-use, open-source platform allows you to generate wallets, interact with (Drips) smart contracts, and more.

- The [web3.js Library][w3] makes it easy to interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, including the Drips smart contracts.

- The [ethers.js Library][et] is another Javascript library for interacting directly with Ethereum smart contracts, including the Drips smart contracts.
