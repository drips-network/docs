# ðŸ’§Drips SDK

The **Drips SDK** is a TypeScript library for building applications that interact with the [Drips protocol](https://github.com/drips-network/contracts).
It wraps much of the [Drips App](https://www.drips.network)'s functionality to make common operations re-usable.

The Drips SDK exposes a type-safe API for Drip Lists creation and management, one-time and continuous donations, fund collection, and utility functions.
