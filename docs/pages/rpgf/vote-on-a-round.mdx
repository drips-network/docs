import Figure from '../../components/Figure'

As a _badgeholder_ in a Drips RetroPGF Round, your role is to evaluate the contributions of applicants and allocate votes to reward the impact you believe they've created. This guide will walk you through the voting process.

To vote in a round, your Ethereum address must have been designated as a badgeholder by the round's administrators.

## How to Vote

The voting process is designed to be straightforward, allowing you to focus on making informed decisions. Your progress is saved locally in your browser as you build your ballot, so you can take your time and resume at any point.

### 1. Access the Round

First, navigate to the public page of the round you wish to vote on. Once the voting phase is active, you will see a prompt to begin. Connect the wallet that has been designated as a badgeholder and sign in. This is a free, gas-less signature to verify your identity.

Once signed in, click the **Vote now** button in the top-right corner of the page to enter the voting interface.

### 2. Build Your Ballot

The first step is to review the list of all accepted applications. You can browse, search, and filter to find the projects you want to support. If the round organizers have provided voting guidelines, you will be prompted to review them here.

Select a set of applications that you want to allocate votes to. This creates your personal _ballot_.

### 3. Allocate Votes

After selecting your projects, you will proceed to your ballot. Here, you will see only the applications you chose. Enter the amount of votes you want to assign to each one.

The interface will show you how many votes you have available to allocate in total, and will respect the "maximum votes per project" limit if one was set by the round's admins.

### 4. Submit Your Ballot

Once you are satisfied with your vote allocation, click the submit button. You will be asked to sign a message with your wallet to confirm your submission. This is also a free, gas-less action.

**Your ballot is private.**
Once submitted, your ballot is recorded securely. Its contents are only visible to the round's administrators to ensure voter privacy.

## Editing Your Ballot

You can change your mind at any time while the voting period is still active.

To edit your submission, simply return to the round's page. The button in the top-right will now say **Edit your ballot**. Clicking it will take you back to the voting interface, where you can modify your project selections and vote allocations and resubmit your ballot. You can edit and resubmit as many times as you like before the voting period ends.
