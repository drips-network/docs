# Applying to a RetroPGF Round

import Figure from '../../components/Figure'

Applying to a RetroPGF round on Drips allows you to showcase your past contributions and be considered for funding by the round organizers. This guide explains the application process from the perspective of an applicant.

You can submit applications to any round that is currently in the "Registration" phase.

## Before You Apply: Your Drips Project

All applications to an RPGF round must be submitted on behalf of a Drips _Project_. A Project on Drips is a claimed GitHub repository that can receive and split funds automatically.

This means you must [claim a GitHub repository on Drips](/get-support/claim-your-repository) before or during the application process.

:::info
**Not an open-source project?**
If you are an individual or organization without a dedicated GitHub repository, you can still apply by creating an otherwise empty GitHub repository to represent your entity on Drips. We are working on allowing applications with only an Ethereum address in the future.
:::

:::info
**On supported networks including Filecoin, Drips will cover the transaction fee ("gas") required for claiming a project.** You can disable gasless transactions under Settings â†’ Gasless transactions. 
:::

### How Payouts Work

If your application is successful, any rewards from the round will be paid out directly to your Drips Project. These funds will then be automatically distributed according to your Project's configured splits between maintainers and dependencies.

For example, if your Project is configured to forward 20% of incoming funds to its dependencies, that same 20% of any RetroPGF rewards sent to your project by the round organizers will be automatically forwarded to the open-source projects you rely on.

:::info
While optional, forwarding even a small percentage of funds to your software dependencies is a **great way to support the projects that enable your success**. Consider adding your key dependencies to your Project's splits for a fairer, more equitable open-source ecosystem.

## How to Apply

During a round's application phase, follow these steps to submit your application.

### 1. Start Your Application

Navigate to the round's public page. If the application period is open, you will see an **Apply now** button in the top-right corner. Click it, then connect your Ethereum wallet and sign in with a free signature to begin.

### 2. Select Your Project

You will be asked to select which of your claimed Drips Projects you are applying with. If you haven't claimed your project yet, you can use the **Claim new project** button to start that process first.

### 3. Pick a category

Choose from one of the available categories for the given round. The category you choose determines the application form fields shown in the next step.

### 4. Fill Out the Application Form

Fill out the application form fields truthfully. The questions and required information are configured by the round's organizers to help round voters evaluate your project's impact.

:::danger
Fields **NOT** marked with a lock icon (ðŸ”’) are public. Any information you enter into these fields will be permanently published to the blockchain and will be publicly visible to everyone. Only enter sensitive information into fields that are marked as private.
:::

### 5. Submit Your Application

Once you have filled out all the required fields, click submit. Submitting an application requires a blockchain transaction to create a permanent, verifiable record of your submission.

:::info
**On supported networks including Filecoin, Drips will cover the transaction fee ("gas") for you.** You can disable gasless transactions under **Settings** â†’ **Gasless transactions**. 
:::

:::info
Your application's public information will be uploaded to IPFS and **attested to on-chain** via the [Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)](https://attest.sh/). After the round organizers have reviewed and approved your application, it will be publicly visible on Drips.

## After You've Applied

### Checking Your Application Status

After submitting, you can view your application and check its status. Initially, its status will be `Pending`. The round organizers will review it and change its status to either `Approved` or `Rejected`.

* **Approved** applications become publicly visible on the round page (excluding any private data).
* **Pending** and **Rejected** applications are only visible to you and the round admins.

If your application was rejected by the round organizers, you have the option to "re-submit" it by making an edit anytime during the application period (See [Updating An Application](#updating-an-application)). Doing so will move its status back to `Pending`.

To see all your submissions, navigate to the round's main page, sign in, and filter the list of applications by **"Own applications"**.

### Verifying Your Identity (KYC/KYB)

The round's organizers may require you to complete an external KYC (Know Your Customer) / KYB (Know Your Business) identitify verification process before you can receive any rewards. If KYC/KYB is required, you will see a notification on your application page with a link to start the process. Follow the instructions provided to complete your verification.

:::info
The specific provider used may vary between rounds. If you have any questions or concerns about the KYC/KYB process, please contact the round organizers directly.
:::

### Updating An Application

You can update your application at any time during the round's application phase. To do so, navigate to the application you'd like to edit, ensure you're signed in as the applicant,
and click "Edit" in the top right. Make the desired adjustments, then confirm with your wallet.

Please note that **updating your application will move it back `Pending` status**, meaning it will need to be reviewed again by the round organizers.

:::info
Application information is fully historized. Anyone can see the history of an application by clicking the "History" button in the top-right corner of the application view.
:::

### Receiving Rewards

Rewards are sent **directly to the Drips project you applied with**. Once sent by the round organizers, the funds received by your project will be split according to your configured list of maintainers and (optionally) dependencies, and become collectable by their recipients. You can check whether your connected address has any collectable funds by connecting your wallet to the Drips app and clicking the "Collect" button in the top-right corner.

:::info
Please note that depending on the chain that rewards are being distributed on, funds may reach you only after a short [settlement period](/get-support/claim-your-repository#settlement-of-future-funds).
