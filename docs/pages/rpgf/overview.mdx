# RetroPGF on Drips

import Figure from '../../components/Figure'

Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) is a powerful mechanism for funding impactful work that has already been completed. Instead of funding promises about future work, RPGF allows communities to identify and reward projects and individuals who have already provided demonstrable value. This "results-based" approach helps ensure that funds are directed effectively towards proven contributors.

Drips provides a comprehensive, on-chain platform to run your own RPGF rounds from start to finish.

## The Anatomy of an RPGF Round

On Drips, the entire RPGF process is organized into discrete events called _Rounds_. While every round is unique, they generally follow three main stages:

1.  **Application**: Projects and individuals submit applications to showcase their past work and impact, hoping to be considered for funding.
2.  **Voting**: A group of designated voters, often called _badgeholders_, review the applications and vote to allocate the round's funding pool among the applicants they believe have created the most value.
3.  **Payout**: Once voting is complete, the results are tallied and the funds are distributed to the winning applicants based on the voting outcomes.
