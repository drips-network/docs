# Drips Wave - Terms and Conditions

## 1. Introduction

Bounty sprints (“**Drips Wave Programs**”) in which you may participate as a contributor or maintainer (“**you**”, “**your**” or “**Participant**”), are hosted on the platform (“**Wave Platform**”) developed by the Public Goods Association (“**Association**”, “**we**”, “**our**”), a Swiss association with its registered seat is in Zug. Drips Wave Programs are designed to reward genuine impact within a designated third-party ecosystem. Each Drips Wave Program may consist of a series of waves (“**Drips Waves**”).

These terms and conditions (“**Terms**”) govern the access to and the participation in the Drips Wave Programs, in particular but without limitation, the rights and obligations of Participants arising from or in connection with the Drips Wave Programs. The Terms, together with any and all other documents referred to herein and any documentation made available on [https://docs.drips.network/wave/](https://docs.drips.network/wave/), govern your access to and participation in Drips Wave Programs, including all related tools, web applications, smart contracts, and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) made available thereon.

These Terms may be updated and modified from time to time. The Terms as so updated and modified are deemed effective as of the date they are published on the website [https://docs.drips.network/wave/terms-and-rules](https://docs.drips.network/wave/terms-and-rules). It is the Participant’s responsibility to periodically check for the most recent version of the Terms.

By ticking the acceptance box, and/or by accessing, applying to participate in, or participating in any Drips Wave Program, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms and any and all other terms, documents or policies incorporated herein by reference.

## 2. Responsibility

Drips Wave Programs are initiated by third-party ecosystems (“**Wave Program Organizers**”). The Association is responsible for organizing the Drips Wave Programs and hosting the Drips Wave Programs on the website [https://www.drips.network/wave](https://www.drips.network/wave) (“**Drips Wave App**”).

## 3. Drips Wave Program Participants

### 3.1 Maintainers

A maintainer (“**Maintainer**”) may submit a repository, containing a set of technical issues, for consideration in a Drips Wave Program. The Association and the Wave Program Organizer retain sole discretion to select which repositories are admitted to a Wave Program and may remove a repository at any time during the Drips Wave Program. If your repository was rejected, you may reach out to us as [https://www.drips.network/wave/login?backTo=/wave/support](https://www.drips.network/wave/login?backTo=/wave/support).

The selection of a repository for a Drips Wave Program does not transfer ownership or control of that repository to the Association. The Association does not own, operate, manage, or control any repositories applying to or participating in a Drips Wave Program.

### 3.2 Contributors

Contributors (“**Contributors**”) apply to work on issues listed in repositories and, subject to the impact of their contributions, may become eligible to earn Wave Rewards.

## 4. Eligibility

To be eligible to participate in any Drips Wave Program, the Participant represents and warrants that:

* You are 18 years old or qualify as an adult in your country of residence.
* You, including your affiliates, officers, and directors, are not a citizen or resident of, and are not located in, any jurisdiction that is subject to comprehensive sanctions or embargoes imposed by the United Nations, Switzerland, the European Union, the United States, or any other relevant authorities.
* Neither you nor any of your affiliates, officers, or directors are listed on, or owned or controlled by any person or entity listed on, the Overall List of Sanctioned Individuals, Entities and Organizations maintained by the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), the EU Consolidated List of Persons, Groups, and Entities Subject to EU Financial Sanctions, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Persons or Entity List, the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Specially Designated Nationals or Blocked Persons Lists, the U.S. Department of State’s Debarred Parties List, or any other national or international sanctions or embargo list.
* You, including your affiliates, officers, and directors, are not a resident or citizen of, and are not located in, any geographic area designated as non-cooperative with international anti-money-laundering (AML) principles or procedures by any intergovernmental organization, including the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
* You, including your affiliates, officers, and directors, are not domiciled in and are not organized under the laws of any jurisdiction whose legislation conflicts with the Drips Wave Programs.

The Participant acknowledges and agrees that all determinations regarding eligibility, participation in Drips Wave Programs, and entitlement to Wave Rewards (as defined in Section 5) are made at the sole, absolute, and final discretion of the Association. This implies that the Association may accept, reject, suspend, or remove any Participant from any Drips Wave Program at any time, for any reason.

## 5. Waves Rewards

### 5.1 Wave Rewards Calculation

For each Wave, a maximum reward pool (“**Total Reward Pool Size**”) is determined by the Association.

Wave Rewards (“**Wave Rewards**”) are granted to Participants based on their performance within a Wave Program. Wave Rewards are calculated according to a point system (“**Points**”) developed by the Association to assess a Participant’s contributions to the Wave Program Organizers’ ecosystem. Points have no monetary value and do not constitute a currency, a means of exchange, or a store of value.

Unless expressly stated otherwise, Points earned during a Wave or a Wave Program do not carry over to any subsequent Waves or future Wave Programs and automatically expire upon termination of the applicable Wave Program.

The calculation and application of the exchange rate between Points and the Token are determined solely at the discretion of the Association and may be modified at any time. The Association may also establish limits on the maximum Wave Reward a Participant may be entitled to receive.

All decisions made by the Association in relation to Wave Rewards are final.

### 5.2 Wave Rewards Denomination

Wave Rewards are generally paid in the token of the Wave Program Organizer (“**Token**”). However, the Association may, for compliance, operational, or other legitimate reasons, settle Wave Rewards in other cryptocurrencies or in fiat currencies.

### 5.3 Wave Rewards Allocation

The Participant understands that, in order to claim any Wave Reward, the Association or its appointed service provider (“**KYC Service Provider**”) may require all information, documentation, and evidence reasonably requested to complete the know-your-customer or know-your-business verification process (“**KYC / KYB Check**”). The Participant understands that the outcome of the KYC/KYB Check lies solely within the discretion of the Association and/or the KYC Service Provider. The Participant further accepts that the scope and requirements of the KYC / KYB Check may evolve over time and that additional information or documentation may be requested at a later stage.

Successful completion of the KYC / KYB Check, as well as continued compliance with these Terms, is a prerequisite for the allocation of any Wave Rewards.

### 5.4 Unclaimed Wave Rewards

If a Participant fails to claim their Wave Rewards within a reasonable period of time as determined by the Association, the Association may deem such Rewards to be unclaimed. In such circumstances, the Association is entitled to retain, reallocate, or otherwise repurpose the unclaimed Wave Rewards for use in subsequent Drips Wave Programs. Participants acknowledge and agree that they shall have no further rights or claims to any Wave Rewards deemed unclaimed under this clause.

### 5.5 Other Variables

In addition to Points, the Association may, at its sole discretion, consider other qualitative or quantitative factors to reward Maintainers’ contribution to Drips Wave Programs. The Association may therefore allocate part of the Total Reward Pool directly to a Maintainer, independently of the point‑based calculation.

## 6. Prohibited Activities

The Participant shall refrain from engaging in any of the following prohibited activities (“**Prohibited Activities**”):

* Engaging in any activity intended to generate Points or Wave Rewards through low-effort or bad-faith submissions, including but not limited to:
    * Submitting pull requests or contributions consisting solely of trivial typo corrections or similar low-value changes for the purpose of accumulating Points;
    * Submitting code, documentation, or other contributions generated by large language models (“**LLMs**”) that are of low quality, untested, or not understood by the Contributor;
    * Requesting repeated assignment to issues without reviewing their scope or without verifying whether the issue has already been assigned to another Contributor; or
    * Submitting code, documentation, or any other contribution that infringes, or may infringe, third‑party intellectual property rights, or that contains viruses, malware, or any other malicious components.
* Manipulating the Point or Wave Reward mechanisms, for example by:
    * Creating or using multiple identities or accounts to apply for issues, influence Points, or affect rankings;
    * Coordinating with others to submit or approve low-quality work, manipulate outcomes, or otherwise distort the integrity of the Drips Wave Programs; or
    * Submitting work that is not the Contributor’s own without proper attribution or authorization.
* Introducing, attempting to introduce, or suggesting the introduction of vulnerabilities, backdoors, malware, or any other harmful code into any repository, or into the Drips Wave App and/or Wave Platform, supporting platform or the Network.
* Interfering with, circumventing, or compromising the security, availability, or integrity of the Drips Wave App and/or Wave Platform associated infrastructure;
* Disrupting, compromising, or otherwise damaging data or property owned by the Association or any other party;
* Interfering with, or attempting to interfere with, the access of any user, host, or network, including, without limitation, by sending viruses, overloading, flooding, spamming, or creating, encouraging, or implementing Sybil attacks;
* Attempting to circumvent geographic restrictions;
* Encouraging or enabling any other individual or entity to engage in any of the foregoing or otherwise violate these Terms.

If the Association determines, in its sole discretion, that a Participant has engaged in any Prohibited Activity, it may take the actions set forth in Section 7.

## 7. Remedies and Enforcement

In the event that a Participant breaches these Terms, the Association may take any corrective or enforcement measures it deems appropriate. Such measures may include, without limitation, deducting Points earned in current or previous Waves, and temporarily or permanently suspending the Participant’s access to the Drips Wave App and their participation in any current or future Drips Wave Programs. The Association may also withhold or cancel any pending or future Wave Rewards or reclaim Wave Rewards that have already been distributed.

The Association reserves all other rights and remedies available under applicable law.

## 8. Wallet

Claiming the Tokens from the Wave Rewards may require reliance on or an integration with third party products (e.g., a wallet, a network, or blockchain) that neither the Association nor the Wave Program Organizer control. In particular, neither the Association nor the Wave Program Organizer has control over the private keys of the Participant and the use of the wallet is subject to the terms and conditions of the respective third-party wallet provider. Neither the Association nor the Wave Program Organizer has custody or control of the wallets and Participants are solely responsible for the security of their wallet. Neither the Association nor the Wave Program Organizer is not responsible for managing and maintaining the security of Participant’s wallets.

Tokens allocated to the Participant’s address can only be accessed with the Participant’s access data and/or private key. The Participant understands and accepts that if its private key or wallet password were lost or stolen, the access to the Participant’s Tokens allocated to the Participant’s address would be unrecoverable and would be permanently lost. Neither the Association nor the Wave Program Organizer has control over the Participant’s Tokens; therefore, the Participant shall have no recourse to seek any refunds, recovery or replacements from neither the Association, nor the Wave Program Organizer in the event that he/she cannot access the wallet and/or Tokens anymore and/or any Tokens are lost or stolen.

## 9. Data Privacy Policy

The Association handles Participant’s personal information in accordance with Swiss law and its privacy policy, available at [https://www.drips.network/legal/privacy](https://www.drips.network/legal/privacy).

## 10. No Fees

No fees are associated with the participation in the Drips Wave Programs. Participants may have to pay network gas fees to claim any Wave Rewards.

## 11. Warranty Disclaimer and Exclusion of Liability

The access and use of the Drips Wave App and related infrastructure is made at your own risk. You understand and agree that the Drips Wave App and supporting infrastructure is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis and that the Association expressly disclaims all warranties or conditions of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise.

The Association disclaims all liability for any losses arising from (i) failures or malfunctions of any blockchain or network, (ii) bugs or vulnerabilities in the Wave Platform Network, the Drips Wave App and respective supporting technology or any smart contract, (iii) code mergers into repositories (iv) hacks, exploits, or malicious attacks, and (v) any third-party services, products, or infrastructure (including wallets).

Except in cases of gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct, the Association shall not be liable to the Participant for any damages arising out of or in connection with these Terms, including, without limitation, indirect or consequential damages such as loss of profit, loss of business opportunity, or reputational harm.

## 12. Indemnification

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Participant will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Association, the Association’s respective past, present, and future members of the board, founders, employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants, suppliers, vendors, service providers, developers, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, predecessors, successors and assignees (“**Association Parties**”) from and against all claims, demands, actions, damages, losses, costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) that arise from or relate to any violation of these Terms, including any inaccuracies in the provided representations and warranties, and any ensuing regulatory enforcement actions, whether arising from the Participant’s actions or omissions. The Association reserves the right to exercise sole control over the defense, at the Participant’s expense, of any claim subject to indemnification under this Section. This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in a written agreement between the Participant and the Association.

## 13. Intellectual Property

The Association retains all rights, title and interest in and to its intellectual property rights.

Participation in Drips Wave Programs does not assign, transfer, or otherwise convey to the Association any rights, title, or interests - including intellectual property rights - in any materials, code, or documentation contributed, made available or created by a Participant in connection with the Drips Wave Programs.

The Contributor undertakes to contribute to repositories under the applicable open‑source licenses as communicated on the Drips Wave App and/or in the relevant repository.

## 14. Tax Considerations

The Participant will bear sole responsibility for any and all taxes, levies, charges, and fees (including, where applicable, VAT) that may arise from the participation in the Drips Wave Programs, the allocation, receipt, holding, transfer, or use of Tokens provided pursuant to or otherwise associated with these Terms. The Participant is solely responsible for identifying and meeting all tax obligations as required by applicable laws.

By accepting these Terms, the Participant acknowledges that neither the Association nor any Association Party shall be held responsible for any tax obligations of the Participant. The Participant also agrees to comply with all relevant tax laws, and to indemnify and hold harmless the Association and Association Parties against any liabilities arising from non-payment of such taxes or fees by the Participant.

## 15. Relationship of the Parties

The Association and the Participant are independent parties. These Terms do not create, nor are they intended to create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between the Association and the Participant.

## 16. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of the Terms or invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the Terms shall be modified to effectuate the original intent of the original provision as closely as possible.

## 17. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

These Terms and all claims relating to or arising out of these Terms, or the breach thereof, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be governed by Swiss Law, excluding Swiss choice-of-law principles.

Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of, or in relation to, these Terms, including the validity, invalidity, breach, or termination thereof, shall be resolved by the ordinary courts in Zug, Switzerland.
