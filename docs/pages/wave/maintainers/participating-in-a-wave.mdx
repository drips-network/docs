# Participating in a Wave

import Figure from "../../../components/Figure";

As a Project Maintainer, Drips Wave allows you to leverage your community to accelerate development. By identifying "good first issues" or critical maintenance tasks, you can attract contributors who are ready to build. Participation is entirely free for maintainers, and Wave Organizers (e.g. the Stellar Development Foundation) provide a funding pool to reward contributors for their work, allowing you to incentivize contributions without impacting your budget.

To participate, you join a **Wave Program** (e.g., the Stellar Wave Program). A Program is a long-running initiative that spawns recurring **Waves** (sprints). You add issues to the Program, and they become available for contributors to tackle during the next active Wave.

## Setting Up Your Organization

To participate, you must first onboard your GitHub organization and apply your repositories to a Wave Program.

1.  **Sign In**: Go to [the Drips Wave app](https://www.drips.network/wave) and log in with your GitHub account.
2.  **Navigate to Onboarding**: In the main navigation, select **Maintainers → Orgs and Repos**.
3.  **Install the App**: Follow the prompts to install the **Drips Wave GitHub App** on the organization hosting your repositories. This allows Drips to track issues and labels.
4.  **Sync and Apply**: Select the public repositories you wish to sync. You must explicitly apply these repositories to a specific Wave Program. Only apply to Programs that are relevant to your ecosystem.
5.  **Wait for Approval**: Repository applications require approval from the Wave Program organizers. You will receive an email and an in-app notification once your repositories have been accepted. You can also check the status of your application at any time on the **Maintainers → Orgs and Repos** dashboard.

## Adding Issues to a Wave Program

Once your repository is approved, issues from that repo will appear in your **Maintainers → Issues** dashboard. From here, you can select which issues to add to the Wave Program.

### Setting Complexity and Points

When adding an issue, you must assign a complexity level. This determines the total Points a contributor earns for resolving it:

- **Trivial**: Worth **100 Points** (Base). Best for typos, small bug fixes, or minor copy changes.
- **Medium**: Worth **150 Points** (Base + 50 Complexity Bonus). Standard features or involved bug fixes.
- **High**: Worth **200 Points** (Base + 100 Complexity Bonus). Complex features, refactors, or new integrations.

### The GitHub Label Workflow

Alternatively, you can manage issues directly from GitHub without leaving your code.

When an issue is added to a Program, the Drips Wave bot will post a comment and apply a label (e.g., `Stellar Wave`). You can also **add** an issue to a Program simply by applying this label yourself on GitHub. This only works if the repository has already been approved for that specific Wave Program.

## During a Wave

As soon as a Wave cycle begins, contributors can start applying to work on the issues you have added to the Program. You will be notified via email and in-app notifications when you receive applications.

### Assigning Contributors

Speed is critical. Maintainers are urged to review applications and assign contributors quickly to ensure they have enough time to resolve the issue before the Wave ends.

When reviewing applicants, you will see a **Code Metrics** scorecard and **Languages** profile sourced from their GitHub activity. This includes metrics like Total Merged PRs, PR Merge Rate, and an OSS Activity Score, with categorical bins comparing the contributor against ~3.9 million GitHub users. For details on how these metrics are calculated, see [Applicant metrics](/wave/applicant-metrics).

You can accept an application in two ways:

1.  **Via Dashboard**: Use the **Maintainers → Issues** dashboard to view applicant stats and accept one.
2.  **Via GitHub**: Simply assign the contributor to the issue directly on GitHub.

### Tracking Progress

The **Maintainers → Issues** dashboard is your central hub. It allows you to filter and quickly see:

- Issues with pending applications.
- Issues with open Pull Requests requiring review.
- Issues that are assigned but stale.

## Resolution and Rewards

When a contributor submits a Pull Request, you review and merge it as normal. Once the issue is marked as resolved
during an active Wave, the contributor earns the Points allocated to that issue.

:::info
**Timing is Critical:** Issues must be marked as resolved **before the Wave ends** for contributors to receive
their points for that cycle. If a submitted PR is high quality but cannot be merged yet for reasons outside the
contributor's control (e.g., feature freeze or blocked dependencies), we strongly urge you to mark the issue as
resolved anyway. This ensures the contributor is fairly rewarded for their work.

### Leaving Reviews

After an issue is resolved, both the maintainer and the assigned contributor can leave a **two-way review** within
**14 days** of the issue being closed. Reviews help build reputation and improve collaboration across the
ecosystem.

#### How It Works

Each review consists of:

1. **Overall Experience** (required): Rate the collaboration as "Below expectations", "Alright", or "Exceeded
   expectations".
2. **Category Ratings** (optional): Rate specific aspects on a 1–5 star scale.
3. **Comment** (optional): Provide open-ended feedback (up to 5,000 characters).

The specific rating categories depend on your role:

**When a maintainer reviews a contributor:**

- **Communication Quality** — How well did the contributor communicate progress, questions, and blockers?
- **Code Quality** — How clean, well-structured, and maintainable was the contributor's code?
- **Timeliness** — How responsive was the contributor while working on this issue?
- **Problem Solving** — How well did the contributor handle challenges and find solutions independently?

**When a contributor reviews a maintainer:**

- **Communication Quality** — How well did the maintainer communicate expectations, feedback, and decisions?
- **Issue Clarity** — How clear and well-defined was the issue description and its requirements?
- **Repo Code Quality** — How well-organized and easy to work with was the repository's codebase?
- **Timeliness** — How responsive was the maintainer when reviewing PRs and answering questions?

:::info
**Reviews are anonymous.** Maintainers and contributors only receive an anonymous rating summary after the Wave
ends. Please be honest and truthful in your reviews. Note that other members of your GitHub organization can view
and re-submit a review left on behalf of the org.
:::

You can update your review at any time before the 14-day deadline. After the deadline passes, reviews can no longer
be submitted or changed.

### Issue Rollover

If an issue is added to a Wave Program but is not resolved during the current Wave, it automatically remains in the
Program. It will be eligible for applications again in the next Wave cycle unless you explicitly remove it.
