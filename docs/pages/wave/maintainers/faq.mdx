# FAQ for Maintainers

These frequently asked questions cover the essentials of nominating issues, managing time, and understanding how your contributors get paid.

## How do I add issues to a Wave?
You can add issues in two ways:
1.  **Via the Drips App (Recommended):** Navigate to **Maintainers → Issues**, select the issue, and click **Add to Wave**. This allows you to immediately set the Complexity Level (Trivial, Medium, or High).
2.  **Via GitHub:** You can simply apply the specific Wave Program label (e.g., `Stellar Wave`) to an issue directly on GitHub.
    * *Note:* Issues added via GitHub are automatically assigned **Trivial** complexity (100 Points). To increase the value for harder tasks, you must log in to the Drips App and edit the issue's complexity.

## What is the expected time commitment?
A Wave is a sprint, so responsiveness is key.
* **Before the Wave:** Spend 1-2 hours selecting and scoping "good first issues."
* **During the Wave (1 week):** Check your dashboard daily to review applications and assign contributors. This prevents bottlenecks.
* **End of Wave:** Prioritize reviewing and merging PRs so contributors earn their points before the deadline. You also have a 7-day window after the Wave ends to issue Compliments.

## How do I distribute the funds?
You do not need to calculate or distribute funds yourself. Your job is simply to mark the issue as **Resolved** in the Drips interface or on GitHub.
* Drips Wave automatically calculates the contributor's share of the pool based on the issue's Point value.
* Payouts are sent strictly to the contributor's registered wallet address.

## How is the funding pool determined?
Each Wave (sprint) has a fixed Reward Budget (e.g., $10,000) set by the Wave Program Organizers. This amount is visible on the Explore page. This pool is shared among all contributors in that specific Wave based on the points they earn.

## What if a contributor disputes my decision?
If a contributor feels their work was unfairly rejected or scored:
1.  **Communicate:** Try to resolve it via GitHub comments first. Often, it's a misunderstanding about the scope or code quality.
2.  **Escalate:** If the disagreement persists, please direct them to [Drips Wave Support](https://www.drips.network/wave/support). We will review the case and mediate if necessary.
