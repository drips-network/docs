These frequently asked questions cover how to find work, how the point system translates to money, and what is required to get paid.

## How do I find issues to work on?
You can find issues in two ways:
1.  **Drips Wave App:** Navigate to the **Explore** page, click on an active Wave (e.g., Stellar Wave 1), and browse the list of available issues.
2.  **GitHub:** You can search the specific ecosystem's repositories for issues with the Wave label (e.g., `label:"Stellar Wave"`).

## How do I apply for an issue?
Once you find an issue in the Drips App, click **Apply**. You will see a text field where you can write a short message to the maintainer.
* **Tip:** Be concise. Mention your relevant experience or link to a previous PR to increase your chances of being assigned.

## Do I need to pay to participate?
No. Participation is free. However, to receive rewards, you must complete **KYC (Know Your Customer)** verification and set a **Payout Wallet Address** in your settings.

## How are my earnings calculated?
Your earnings are not a fixed dollar amount per issue. Instead, they are based on your share of the total points earned by the community.
* **Base Points:** Every issue has a set value (100, 150, or 200 Points) based on complexity.
* **Compliments:** Maintainers can award bonus points for exceptional work.
* **The Formula:** `(Your Points / Total Points in Wave) * Total Reward Budget` = Your Payout.

## When will I get paid?
Payouts are distributed after the Wave concludes and the 7-day "Compliment Window" for maintainers has closed. Once the final scores are calculated, funds are sent to your registered wallet address.

## What happens if I can't finish an issue on time?
If you realize you cannot complete the issue before the Wave ends, please **notify the maintainer immediately**.
* This allows them to reassign the issue to someone else so the work can still get done.
* If the issue is not resolved by the end of the Wave, you will not receive points for it in that cycle.

## What is the Leaderboard?

The Leaderboard (found under **Wave Program → Leaderboard**) is a real-time ranking of all contributors based on points earned. Since the reward pool is shared proportionally, a higher rank on the leaderboard directly corresponds to a larger share of the reward budget.

## What is the Code Metrics scorecard?

When you apply to an issue, maintainers see a summary of your public GitHub activity including metrics like Total Merged PRs, PR Merge Rate, and an OSS Activity Score. These help maintainers evaluate applicants quickly. For a full explanation of how each metric is calculated and what the categorical bins mean, see [Applicant metrics](/wave/applicant-metrics).
