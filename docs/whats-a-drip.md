*"When I drip you drip we drip"*

Drips is a new Ethereum protocol that allows any creator to generate continuous income from their communities without relying on bank accounts or extracting platforms. 

Using Drips, creators & developers can issue monthly memberships and give their fans unique benefits in exchange for their recurring financial support. Using the permissionless financial infrastructure of Ethereum, Drips memberships are represented by Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). These memberships are available to anyone and can enable benefits across any application on the web that supports Ethereum (Discord, Telegram, Reddit, Snapshot, Radicle Upstream & many more).

Fans can support and engage with their favorite creators and communities by purchasing memberships and by “dripping” funds to any address in the network in recurring configurable intervals.

Finally, Drips allow creators to automatically spread the love every time they get paid by specifying a percentage of their incoming funds to be dripped to other users. The recipient could be a charity, another collective, or another software dependency or creator that makes their work possible. Sharing funds through Drips has the potential to become a new culture norm and building block for a sustainable crypto economy.
