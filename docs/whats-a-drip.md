Drips ðŸ’§ is an Ethereum protocol that allows users and web3 apps to continuously stream funds to others, with continuous settlement for use cases 
like contributor payments, vesting and subscription memberships.

Drips also includes an integrated, fully-featured splitting protocol called Splits ðŸ’¦, which allows for native on-chain splitting of both streamed funds
and one-time transfers. Splits can be used by teams to share incoming funds among themselves, as well as to "spread the love" to other projects or creators
 they depend upon.

## Status of Drips v2

As of 8/17/2022, Drips v2 is currently available as an alpha pre-release, with smart contracts deployed on the Goerli testnet. Versions of the JS SDK and
Subgraph for v2 are currently under development. The Drips Team plans to do a series of iterative deployments to Goerli over the coming weeks, which will add in a few additional features and bug fixes, leading up to a mainnet release in August or September 2022.
