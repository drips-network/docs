Drips üíß is a new protocol (and app), built on Ethereum, that enables organizations and individuals to directly and publicly provide funding to the free and open source software projects they depend on the most.

Drips also includes gas-optimized and integrated primitives for streaming and splitting tokens, allowing users and web3 apps to stream and split funds by the second with continuous settlement for use cases like contributor payments, vesting and subscription memberships.

At the core of the Drips user experience is the idea of a **Drip List**. This is a collection of Ethereum addresses, ENS names and Git repositories curated by an individual or organization and packaged together under one title. This list is accompanied by a percentage (of funds to be received) allocated to each item on the list. These lists are publicly available, shareable on the web with the ability to be either editable or immutable.

With Drip Lists we make project recipient lists permanent, public, and open for anyone to support. This allows the creator to curate a list of recipients and provide context about them, effectively signaling to other supporters by setting an example. All of this makes it simpler to discover projects and people in need in your ecosystem and transparently support them.
