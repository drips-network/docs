Drips ðŸ’§ is an Ethereum protocol for streaming and splitting tokens. It allows users and web3 apps to stream and split funds by the second, enabling continuous settlement for use cases like contributor payments, vesting and subscription memberships.

## Status of Drips v2

As of 11/4/2022, Drips v2 is currently available as an alpha pre-release, with smart contracts deployed on the Goerli testnet.
We expect to deploy the smart contracts to Ethereum mainnet and other major EVM blockchains soon!
